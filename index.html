  <h4>SAVOR IT</h4>
  <p>
    People love 2 things in the world, food and impulse shopping. Combining that with a social media aspect and you have SavorIt. Savorit is a social media app with the basic idea of your friends posting food that they have eaten at certain restaurants in your local area. The main distinction between this and instagram is that all of these food products in your local area can be bought and delivered straight from the SavorIt application. Thus feeding all of your food cravings and also giving you ideas of what you want to eat instead of going to Yelp, searching through a ton of random restaurants and deciding what you want after looking at their menu. The pictures give users a mental stimulation of what you actually want to eat and the capability to buy whatever food you want that your friends are showing you.

  <h4>CARTO-GRAPHIC</h4>
  <p>
    Having been raised in Kansas, then moving around the East Coast and abroad, I always found an interest in seeing what large city I might venture to next. However, there are certain factors (in my case, housing prices and diversity) that influence  the next place I could call “home.” Often times just reading numbers and statistics about the demographic make-up of a city can be quite hard to immediately grasp. Carto-graphic allows users to see maps of housing prices and racial diversity by zip code in several of the US’s largest cities. When presented with these visual representations, data is much easier to make sense of and understand. This website is ideal for those who want to find a neighborhood that is within their price range and fits their diversity preferences. It is also a great learning tool for those who are interested in seeing how different cities are composed.

    Alpine takes its inspiration from the building murals that are found in Alpine, Texas.  This application provides an approach to  “shoeboxing” an image for safe keeping.   Alpine provides a method to catalog, reference and display building art I find and keep the images and locations documented for later reference.  An image can be captured and transferred to the application with the time and location data extracted from the image data. Users can vote on their favorite murals and view them on a map, helping the daily commuter experience a hidden world that would perhaps otherwise not be seen.

  <h4>LEARNING HISTORY EARLY</h4>
  <p>
    History is a subject important to fully understanding society and the world around us. Unfortuantely, any kids don't get in to history...in fact, they find it boring. Learning History Early is an app presented as an interactive timeline that kids can scroll through. The timeline lists several interesting figures from history: some that kids may know and others they may not have heard of before. The experience of this app allows kids early access to history in a way that is accessible and fun to them.

    Roomies was created to help members of a shared living space manage their chores. The app allows all members of a household to contribute to a shared chores list. Each member can then claim the chores for which they agree to complete. This allows for an easy and interactive way to divide and conquer all of the shared responsibilities of the household. With the Roomies app, sharing a home has never been easier.

  <h4>JAM SESH</h4>
  <p>
    
Music was my first love before I thought to code.   I played in a metal band with my brother since highschool  and lots of practice went into making sure our songs were tight and show performance was on point.  One of the biggest problems however was just getting 5 guys in a room at the same time and place.  Jam Sesh is a tool to help bands organize and set practice dates and shows.  As a leader,  you can set practice dates and times while gaining the notification when your band mates see and approve it.  As a member, you can quickly see when the next practice or show is and send your leader confirmation that you'll be there.  Built for mobile devices and desktop view,  its quick, responsive, and intuitive design will let band mates know who will make it, and who's down for a Jam Sesh.

  <p>
    
As I recently gained my U.S. citizenship, I was thrilled to go vote for the first time. There is much to say for the feeling of being heard by your government. However, deciding exactly how to vote wasn't easy:  the ballot had many unfamiliar names and government positions. VoteWrite makes it easier to get ready for the upcoming elections by merging and presenting all needed resources, even opinions of community leaders and peers on each candidate. Run a custom search, take, share and read notes, build a ballot cheat sheet, or simply take this mobile-friendly app to the polls with you on election day. Get ready to make a difference!

  <h4>GIFTHORSE</h4>
  <p>
    Make the Internet slow again; get a GiftHorse! When a universe of digital content is literally at our fingertips, GiftHorse allows gifters to send digital surprises that can't be unlocked right away. The idea of waiting for something makes it more exciting—anticipate a treat waiting after a busy work week, or a present that opens itself only at a special time (even if that "special time" is Monday 4pm, and it's currently Monday 10 am!) The gift-giver includes a URL that can securely link to an Amazon gift card, Steam key, or other digital reward, then the gift's recipient is notified that *a surprise* is coming, and they can watch as an animated gift horse gallops ever closer along an incremental progress bar. Patience may be its own reward, but it doesn't hurt when it comes with a GiftHorse bearing gifts!

  <h4>DESIGN DASH</h4>
  <p>
    
If you have ever been stuck on where to begin designing or communicating your vision for a website or app, Design Dash is a lightweight prototyping tool built to delight and aid in the aesthetic process. Begin by searching for anything that inspires you–Machu Picchu, Aurora Borealis, or mint-chocolate-chip ice cream. A custom color palette will be generated based on the results of your image search. From there, choose amongst curated font collections and icon sets. View a simulation of your project on a mobile device that is scalable to instantly toggle between multiple screen sizes and view types. When you are satisfied with your chosen colors, fonts, and icons, export a CSS SASS file pre-loaded with your selections to jump start your project, or hand off to a developer!

  <h4>TOTAL BODY DATA</h4>
  <p>
    As the owner/operator of a gym, my sister tracks measurements of her members as they progress towards their fitness goals. The current process of gathering and logging this data has a very 1995 feel to it. Take measurement, jot down number, lock away in boring excel spreadsheet. But what if that data has a story to tell? Total Body Data allows gym staff to quickly and efficiently add members and log member data from any device. This data is immediately available in graphical form for quick visual feedback on individual member progress and overall membership growth. Are members progressing as they should be? Does our marketing/sales strategy need work? Total Body Data keeps gyms informed and makes data-driven decision making a breeze.

    Front End Engineering focuses on creating experiences in web browsers that users see and interact with. The discipline covers a broad area, from web design principles to complex JavaScript applications that manage data. The tools used in Front End Engineering are ubiquitous—no matter the technology used on the Back End, Front-Enders are responsible for delivering the experience and data to the person using the web application.
